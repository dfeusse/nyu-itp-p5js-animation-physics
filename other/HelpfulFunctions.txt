Helpful Functions

.limit(value) - use when need to limit the acceleration, or anything, of object
	Ex. velocity.add(acceleration);
    velocity.limit(topspeed);

PVector.random2D(); - creates a random vector between 0 and 1
	Because it's normalized, can scale by acceleration.mult(0.5), acceleration.mult(random(2)), etc
