if an object has two vectors (where we started before introducing acceleration):

location
velocity

then:
location - describes where it is (starting point)
velocity - describes change in location over time (in update function, add velocity to location, then draw object a location)

i.e. location changes over time by velocity
location.add(velocity)

BUT

if an object has three vectors (ideal)
(from this moment on, we're going to say we're not going to mess with velocity or location)
buttt are going to add a new vector

location
velocity
acceleration

- velocity will now change over time by acceleration
- acceleration can be changing not just magnitude (speeding up or slowing down) but also direction
- so acceleration changes velocity

NOW we're just changing acceleration, that adjusts velocity which adjusts location
